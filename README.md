## 📦 Getting Started

This project uses a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Only the following libraries are supported and installed:

- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
- Built-in Python libraries: `math`, `statistics`, `typing`

Run the following script to set up your virual environment.

```bash
python setup_env.py
```

Make sure to **activate the environment before running your bot** so that it uses only the allowed dependencies.

### On **Mac/Linux**:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### On **Windows**:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

After activation, your terminal should show a prefix like:

```bash
(venv) $
```

To **deactivate**, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```
